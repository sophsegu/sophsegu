- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sophie SÃ©guin, I'm currently a second year university student at the University of Ottawa. I'm doing a Joint Honours BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in anything to do with computers. I've worked on various projects throughout my time in University and found a true interest in computer science in my time there.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# programming. I want to expand my projects from basic apps such as calculators and DBScan algorithms to more immersive video games.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me through my email soph.segu@gmail.com
